== Introduction

This repository hosts the lab guide for "Using Hosted Control Planes for OpenShift on OpenShift."

It is designed to work with the Showroom lab environment provided by the Red Hat Demo Platform (RHDP) team.

This lab is organized to allow you to have a hands-on experience with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) and to use it to deploy virtual OpenShift on OpenShift clusters with Hosted Control Planes (HCP).

== Lab Content

These are the four main sections that will be covered:

*Deployment:* Using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) to deploy a virtual OpenShift-on-OpenShift cluster using Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization. This section also explores the environment once it's deployed.

*Configuration:* Performing operations on the *hosting* cluster to enact configuration changes on the *hosted* cluster.

*Scaling:* NodePools, used to provide virtual compute nodes for the hosted clusters, can be configured to autoscale when resources are unavaialable to meet application requests. We will deploy an application and scale it up, requiring the hosted cluster to scale up dynamically to meet application needs.

*Cluster Upgrades:* A demonstration of centralized fleet management by exploring cluster upgrade processes, and a walkthrough of the cluster upgrade process using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes.

== Version Information

The current edition of the lab has been developed using the following software versions:

* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes 2.14
* Red Hat OpenShift 4.19
* Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization 4.19
