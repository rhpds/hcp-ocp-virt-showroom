== Lab Content

These are the four main sections that will be covered in the lab:

*Deploy a hosted cluster:* Using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) to deploy a virtual OpenShift on OpenShift cluster using Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization.
This section also explores the environment once it is deployed.

*Creating users on the hosted cluster:* Setting up authorization for the hosted cluster by modifing the HostedCluster custom resource on the hosting cluster.

*Managing hosted clusters using policies:* Using policies to deploy and manage authentication, authorization, and deploy operators. 

*Scaling the cluster:* Using the autoscale feature to dynamically scale the hosted cluster to meet the application needs.

*Upgrade the hosted cluster:* An exploration of centralized fleet management by experiencing the cluster upgrade processes, and a walkthrough of the cluster upgrade process using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes.

// *Storage:* Using the UI create a PVC inside of the guest cluster.

== Lab access

=== OpenShift Console access

Navigate to your {openshift_cluster_console_url}[OpenShift cluster console^].

An administrator user has been configured, and login is available with the following credentials:

* *User:* `{openshift_cluster_admin_username}`
* *Password:* `{openshift_cluster_admin_password}`

NOTE: Bastion access for this lab is unnecessary. There are only two command line activities in this lab, and both are done in the OpenShift command line terminal.
