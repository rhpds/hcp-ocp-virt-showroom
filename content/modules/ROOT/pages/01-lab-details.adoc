== Lab Content

These are the four main sections that will be covered in the lab:

*Deployment:* Using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) to deploy a virtual OpenShift on OpenShift cluster using Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization.
This section also explores the environment once it's deployed.

*Configuration:* Performing operations on the *hosting* cluster to enact configuration changes on the *hosted* cluster.

*Scaling:* NodePools in a hosted control planes environment, like MachineSets in standard clusters, can be configured to autoscale when resources are unavaialable to meet application requests.
In this module we will deploy an application and scale it up, requiring the cluster to scale up dynamically to meet application needs.

*Cluster Upgrades:* This module is an exploration of centralized fleet management by experiencing the cluster upgrade processes, and a walkthrough of the cluster upgrade process using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes.

*Storage:* Using the UI create a PVC inside of the guest cluster.

*Managing clusters using policies:* Using policies to deploy operators and authentication.

== Keys to lab success

An administrator user has been configured, and login is available with the following credentials:

* *User:* `{openshift_cluster_admin_username}`
* *Password:* `{openshift_cluster_admin_password}`

=== Bastion Access

A RHEL bastion host is available with common utilities pre-installed and OpenShift command line access pre-configured {bastion_public_hostname}.

For SSH access to the bastion when needed, use the following credentials:

* *User:* `{bastion_ssh_user_name}`
* *Password:* `{bastion_ssh_password}`
